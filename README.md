# UNIT-1 OOPS – Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains Java projects developed as part of UNIT-1 in Object-Oriented Programming. The focus of this unit is to understand the fundamental building blocks of OOPS and apply them through practical mini projects.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and Objects
- Methods
- Constructors
- Instance Variables
- Object Creation
- Basic Program Structure in Java
- Real-world problem modeling using classes

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Mini Project – Animal Analysis

This project demonstrates the basic implementation of classes and objects in Java. It focuses on creating multiple classes, defining properties, and displaying object-related information.

**Focus Areas:**
- Class creation
- Object instantiation
- Method definition
- Data handling within classes

---

### 2. Project 1 – Student Info Manager

This project manages student details using object-oriented design. It demonstrates how to structure data using classes and how to organize related information logically.

**Focus Areas:**
- Class structure
- Storing and displaying student information
- Method-based operations
- Object interaction

---

### 3. Project 2 – Library Management System

This project models a simple library system using object-oriented concepts. It demonstrates how multiple classes interact to simulate real-world operations.

**Focus Areas:**
- Designing structured classes
- Managing book and user information
- Organized program flow
- Basic data management using objects

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, the following skills were developed:

- Understanding OOPS fundamentals
- Designing modular programs
- Applying classes and objects effectively
- Structuring Java programs logically
- Building simple real-world applications using OOP

---

## Technology Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming Principles
- VS Code / Command Line
- Git and GitHub for version control
